# Research Scraper

L++ skill for searching academic papers from high-quality sources.

## Sources

- **arXiv**: Free preprint server for physics, math, CS, etc.
- **Semantic Scholar**: AI-powered academic search engine
- **Web**: DuckDuckGo fallback for general queries

## Usage

```bash
cd utils/research_scraper
python interactive.py
```

Commands:
- `arxiv <query>` - Search arXiv
- `scholar <query>` - Search Semantic Scholar
- `web <query>` - Search DuckDuckGo
- `select <idx>` - Fetch details for result
- `detail` - Show current detail
- `clear` - Reset state
- `quit` - Exit

## Dependencies
