# TLAPS Seal Certifier

**The Standard for Certified Logic Integrity**

> *Intelligence is the reactant. L++ is the vessel. The TLAPS Seal is the pressure rating.*

## Overview

The TLAPS Seal Certifier is an L++ skill that provides formal verification and certification of L++ blueprints. It implements the transition from **Empirical Observation** (TLC model checking) to **Axiomatic Certainty** (TLAPS theorem proving).

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Axiomatic Sovereignty
Certifies that the blueprint's **Trinity** (Transitions, Gates, Actions) is structurally sound across an infinite state space.

### 2. Compositional Certainty
Validates the **Flange** (context schema) to ensure hermetic data boundaries for safe Logic Stacking.

### 3. Evolutionary Stability
Provides a certification baseline that governs future logic evolution.

## Seal Levels

| Level | Status | Suitable For |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| `TLC_VERIFIED` | Empirical | Lab, Development, Scholar |
| `TLAPS_CERTIFIED` | Axiomatic | Kernel, Infrastructure, Autonomous |

## Usage

```bash
cd utils/tlaps_seal
python interactive.py
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `certify <path>` | Load blueprint and run through TLC verification |
| `prove` | Upgrade from TLC to TLAPS certification (requires TLAPS) |
| `seal` | Grant TLC-level seal without TLAPS proof |
| `view` | Display the seal certificate |
| `reset` | Return to idle state |
| `quit` | Exit |

### Example Session

```
[idle]> certify ../skill_registry/skill_registry.json
Seal: EMPIRICAL | Level: TLC_VERIFIED

[tlc_verified]> prove
Seal: AXIOMATIC | Level: TLAPS_CERTIFIED

  ]
}
```

## The Engineering Oath

By granting the TLAPS Seal, we certify:

1. **The Logic is Converged** - No path leads to an unhandled deadlock
2. **The Context is Hermetic** - No data can violate the schema boundaries
3. **The Flesh is Governed** - The volatile compute layer is strictly bound by the deterministic bone
