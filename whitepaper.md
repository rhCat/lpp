## 1. Abstract
The current AI paradigm relies on "Prompt Engineering"—a non-deterministic, artisanal approach that is incompatible with mission-critical systems. As AI moves into industrial execution, we must move the focus from "Flesh" (the LLM) to "Bone" (the Logic). This paper introduces **L++**, a universal logic frame that reduces agentic behavior to four atomic physics units and gates execution behind **TLAPS Axiomatic Certification**. By treating AI as the "raw material" and carving out deterministic behavior, L++ establishes the **Digital CMC** (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control) required for safe, persistent, and self-evolving autonomy.

## 2. The 4 Axioms of Silicon Reality
L++ is built on the realization that software must reflect the rigidity of its hardware substrate:
1.  **Silicon is Deterministic:** Randomness in software is a failure of engineering.
2.  **Symbolic Sovereignty:** The JSON Blueprint is the absolute source of truth.
3.  **The Separation of Bone and Flesh:** Logic (rules) and Compute (tasks) must never be intertwined.
4.  **The TLAPS Seal:** Production release requires mathematical proof, not empirical hope.

## 3. Architecture: The Trinity and the Atoms
L++ reduces all software complexity to a **Trinity** of symbolic constructs: **Transitions, Gates, and Actions**. These are powered by four underlying, language-agnostic atoms:
- **EVALUATE:** The Judge (Boolean boundary checks).
- **MUTATE:** The Scribe (Deterministic context updates).
- **DISPATCH:** The Messenger (Hermetic I/O to the Flesh).
- **TRANSITION:** The Navigator (Atomic movement of the state pointer).

## 4. The Logic CNC Pipeline
L++ is a manufacturing toolchain for logic:
- **Drafting (CAD):** Designing the logic circuit in JSON.
- **Stress-Testing (FEA):** Using **TLA+** to simulate every possible failure path.
- **Certification (QC):** Using **TLAPS** to axiomatically prove the logic is sound.
- **Extrusion (CNC):** Compiling the verified JSON into high-performance, error-tuple-driven code.

## 5. Self-Evolution and the Logic Commons
L++ is a bootstrapped system. In v1.0.0, L++ was used to decode its own Python source code, refine its logic, and re-manufacture itself. By making L++ public domain, we ensure that the "Rules of the World" remain transparent, auditable, and free from the opacity of corporate monopolies.
