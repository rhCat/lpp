L++ Skill Construction Rules (v1.0)
Overview
L++ (Logic Plus Plus) is a deterministic framework that separates Eternal Logic (The Bone) from Volatile Compute (The Flesh). Every "Skill" added to an agent must be constructed as a verifiable logic circuit.

Mandatory Build Steps
1. The Bone: {skill_name}.json
Define the state machine and business rules.
Schema: Must strictly adhere to schema_v0.1.md.
Traceability: Every transition MUST have a unique id.
Gate Rigor: Gates must be "Light." If a gate requires data transformation or complex math, move that logic to a COMPUTE unit.
Flange Spec: Define a context_schema with strict types. This is how other agents discover and "snap-fit" to this tool.

2. The Flesh: src/{skill_name}_compute.py
Implement the functional compute units.
Hermeticity: Functions must be pure. Input is params: dict, output is result: dict.
Isolation: No global state, no direct I/O. Side effects are managed only via the Frame's DISPATCH atom.
Registry: Export a COMPUTE_REGISTRY mapping "namespace:operation" to the Python function.

3. The Extrusion: interactive.py
Create the minimal execution wrapper.
Constraint: This file must be Minimal (< 50 lines recommended).
Pattern: Use the compile_and_load pattern. It must:
Call frame_py.compiler.compile_blueprint.
Dynamically load the resulting .py operator.
Provide a thin CLI or API to dispatch() events.

4. The Documentation: README.md
Generate the "Logic CAD" view.
Source of Truth: The README must be generated by the L++ Visualizer.
Visuals: Must include a Mermaid Flowchart using the Logic-First template (Diamonds for Gates, Rectangles for Actions).
Logic Netlist: During the build, the agent should maintain a structure.txt—a raw dump of the logic graph used to verify the "Netlist" before final extrusion.

Agent Workflow (The "Pre-frontal" Loop)
When tasked with creating or updating a skill, the Agent MUST follow this deterministic sequence:
DRAFT: Generate/Update {skill_name}.json.
VERIFY: Analyze context_schema to define the Operating Envelope. Generate TLA+ boundary conditions (e.g., int range -5 to 5, history depth 3) to prevent state explosion. Run tla_validator and fix all deadlocks or invariant violations.
IMPLEMENT: Write/Update the hermetic functions in src/.
EXTRUDE: Generate the interactive.py wrapper.
DOCUMENT: Run the visualizer to update the README.md.
Command: python interactive.py export README.md
SIGN-OFF: Present the Mermaid diagram to the Human (Engineer of Record).

Engineering Philosophy for Agents
Logic over Text: Do not debate "vibes." Debate the state graph.
Determinism over Probability: If a behavior is critical, it belongs in the JSON Blueprint, not the LLM prompt.
Transparency: If you cannot visualize the logic, the logic is broken.
How to use this with an Agent:
Upload this file to the agent's knowledge base.
Prompt: "Act as an L++ Logic Engineer. Follow the build_rules.md to create a new skill for [Task Name]. Start by drafting the Bone (JSON)."
Observe: The agent will now treat the task as a systems integration problem rather than a creative writing exercise.
