## The Engineering Oath

Each certified component adheres to:

1. **The Logic is Converged** - No path leads to unhandled deadlock
2. **The Context is Hermetic** - No data violates schema boundaries  
3. **The Flesh is Governed** - Volatile compute is bound by deterministic bone

## Seal Levels

- **EMPIRICAL (TLC_VERIFIED)**: Model-checked across bounded state space
- **AXIOMATIC (TLAPS_CERTIFIED)**: Theorem-proved for infinite state space

## Certificate Files

Each `*_seal.json` contains:
- Blueprint hash for integrity
- Trinity audit (transitions, gates, actions)
- Flange audit (context schema hermeticity)
- TLC verification results
- Timestamp
